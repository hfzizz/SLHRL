SLHRL: Solo Leveling-inspired Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning Agent
Introduction: Problem Definition, Motivation, and Context
Problem Definition
In many RPGs and gaming contexts, characters possess distinct attributes (e.g., Strength, Agility, Mana) and undergo a progression system, gaining experience and upgrading stats as they level up. Reinforcement Learning (RL) offers a framework for creating agents that can learn to optimize their actions based on rewards and punishments.

This project aims to design and develop an RL agent inspired by the Solo Leveling series, where the protagonist (Sung Jinwoo) undergoes a continuous leveling process, improving stats and tackling increasingly difficult challenges. The RL agent in this project will:

Gain stats (Strength, Agility, Stamina, etc.) based on its performance in combat and other tasks.

Learn to make strategic decisions for progression through levels, combat encounters, and skill management.

Manage resources like mana and skill points effectively.

Adapt to increasingly complex scenarios using Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (HRL).

Motivation
Inspired by the Solo Leveling series, the project explores how an RL agent can emulate the protagonist's growth and adaptability. The main objectives of this project are:

Advanced RL Agent Development: To create a robust RL agent capable of hierarchical decision-making in a complex gaming environment.

Simulated RPG Environment: To simulate dynamic, evolving environments inspired by RPG mechanics, where the agent must navigate challenges and improve its stats.

HRL in Game-like Scenarios: To examine the application of Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (HRL) in scenarios involving complex decision-making, such as combat, leveling, and resource management.

Context
Environment Setup: The agent will operate in a “Gate” environment, inspired by RPG dungeons, where monsters spawn, and the agent must defeat them.

Agent Setup: The agent will have initial attributes (Strength, Agility, Stamina, etc.), and it will gain experience by completing quests, defeating bosses, and upgrading its skills.

Game Mechanics: Similar to RPG games, the agent will face challenges such as combat, quest completion, and skill management, all while making strategic decisions to level up and progress through more difficult stages.
