# **SLHRL: Solo Leveling-inspired Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning Agent**

Welcome to **SLHRL** – an exciting Reinforcement Learning project inspired by the *Solo Leveling* series. This project leverages **Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (HRL)** to create an agent that levels up, improves stats, and faces progressively difficult challenges, much like the protagonist, **Sung Jinwoo**.

## **Introduction: Problem Definition, Motivation, and Context**

### **Problem Definition**

In the world of RPGs, characters evolve through a system of stats (Strength, Agility, Mana) and progressively harder challenges. Our goal is to design an **RL agent** that embodies this progression. The agent will:

- Gain stats (Strength, Agility, Stamina) based on combat and task performance.
- Make strategic decisions to navigate through levels, defeat monsters, and use skills effectively.
- Manage resources (mana, skill points) dynamically.
- Adapt to increasingly challenging scenarios using **Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (HRL)**.

### **Motivation**

This project draws inspiration from the *Solo Leveling* series, where the protagonist gains power by completing quests and defeating increasingly powerful monsters. By creating an RL agent based on this system, we aim to explore how HRL can be applied to complex, multi-layered decision-making environments, such as:

- Advanced RL agents that handle hierarchical decision-making.
- Simulated game-like environments inspired by RPG mechanics.
- HRL to address multi-task problems like combat, leveling, and resource management.

### **Context**

- **Environment**: The agent will navigate a “Gate” environment, an RPG-inspired dungeon where monsters spawn, and the agent must defeat them.
- **Agent Setup**: The agent starts with basic stats (Strength, Agility, Stamina) and gains experience through quests, combat, and skill upgrades.
- **Gameplay Mechanics**: The agent must optimize its decisions to handle complex scenarios like quests, combat, and skill management in a dynamic RPG world.

## **Features**

- **Dynamic Environment**: Explore and battle in dungeons filled with progressively harder monsters.
- **Stat Progression**: Level up stats like Strength, Agility, and Stamina based on performance.
- **Resource Management**: Manage mana, health, and skill points for optimal strategy.
- **HRL-Based Agent**: Hierarchical decision-making to handle complex tasks like combat, questing, and resource management.
